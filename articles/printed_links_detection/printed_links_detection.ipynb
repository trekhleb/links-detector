        "\n",
        "- 💚 The detection performance is not limited by the client's device. We may speed the detection up by scaling the service horizontally (adding more instances) and vertically (adding more cores/GPUs).\n",
        "- 💚 The model might be bigger since there is no need to upload it to the client side. Downloading the `~10Mb` model on the client side may be ok, but loading the `~100Mb` model might be a big issue for the client's network and application UX (user experience) otherwise.\n",
        "- 💚 It is possible to controll who is using the model. Model is guarded behind the API so we would have complete controll over its callers/clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons:**\n",
        "\n",

        "- 💔 Too many HTTP requests between the client and the server may become a bottleneck at some point. Imagine if we would want to improve the performance of the detecton, let's say, from `1` to `10+` frames per second. This means that each client will send `10+` requests per second. For `10` simultanious clients it is already `100+` requests per second. The `HTTP/2` bidirectional streaming and `gRPC` might be useful in this case, but we're going back to increased system complexity here.  \n",

        "- 💚 Offline mode is possible. The app doesn't need an internet connection to work since the model is loaded on the device. So the Progressive Web Application ([PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)) might be built to support that.\n",
        "- 💚 System is \"kind of\" scaling automatically. The more clients you have, the more cores and GPUs they bring. This is not a proper scaling solution though (more about that in a Cons section below). \n",
        "- 💚 System is cheaper. We only need a server for static assets (`HTML`, `JS`, `CSS`, model files etc.). This may be done for free, let's say, on GitHub.\n",
        "- 💚 No issue with the growing number of HTTP requests per second to the server side.\n",

        "**Cons:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- 💔 Only the horizontal scaling is possible (each client will have it's own CPU/GPU). Vertical scaling is not possible since we can't influence the client's device performance. As a result we can't guarantee fast detection for low performant devices.\n",

So it will be realy hard to achive those `0.5-1` frames per second to make the user experience at least _close_ to the real-time.\n",
        "\n",
        "💔 Also if we would think about it, we're asking the library to recognize the **whole** text from the image for us even though it might contain only one or two links in it (i.e. only ~10% of the text might be usefull for us) or it may even not contain the links at all. In this case it sounds like a waste of the computational resources. \n",

        "\n",
        "We could make Tesseract work faster if we used some _additional \"adviser\" algorithm_ in prior to the links text recognition. This \"adviser\" algorithm should detect, but not recognize, _the the leftmost position_ of each link on the image if there are any. This will allow us to speed up the recognition part by following these rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. If the image does not contain any link we should not call Tesseract detection/recognition at all.\n",
        "2. If the image does have the links then we need to ask Tesseract to recognize only those parts of the image that contains the links. We're not interested in spending time for recognition of the irrelevant text that doesn't contain the links.\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"adviser\" algorithm that will take place before the Tesseract should work with a constant time regardless of the image quality or the presence/absence of the text on the image. It also should be pretty fast and detect the leftmost positions of the links for less then `1s` so that we could satisfy the \"close-to-real-time\" requirement (i.e. on iPhone X).\n",
        "\n",
        "> 💡 So what if we will use another object detection model to help us find all occurrences of the `https://` substrings (every secure link has this prefix, doesn't it) in the image? Then, having these `https://` bounding boxes in the text we may extract the right-side continuation of them and send them to the Tesseract for text recognition.\n",
